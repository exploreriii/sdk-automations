 * `packages/dev/checks/test/architecture.test.ts` is this file's ENFORCEMENT
 * GATE: it cruises the real tree with these rules and fails on any
 * violation, and it cruises a deliberately-violating fixture tree with the
 * same rules to prove they can still fire. There is no CLI step and no
 * separate CI job — if a rule here stops matching, that test goes red.
 *
 * The gate also supplies the roots to cruise (every workspace package's
 * `src/` and `test/`, plus the lab's local-only harness when it is present),
 * because that list is discovered from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and a config
 * file cannot run discovery.
 *
 * These rules are a LAYER POLICY, not a copied workspace list. The role names
 * below are spelled out only because this file cannot execute the discovery
 * the gate does; everything else — which directories exist, which packages
 * are present — stays derived.
 *
 * Three of those roles — store, adapter and shell — are DIRECTORIES of the
 * runtime package rather than packages of their own (G4). The policy did not
 * change with the filing: the same rules, with the same names and the same
 * reasons, read a directory where they used to read a package.
