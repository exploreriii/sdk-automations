# Facts — what a capability reads, whatever woke the platform

> **Contract (2026-09-09, the ground-up plan's G3).** One fact shape per item kind. A webhook and a
> sweep both produce it; what differs is how much of it they read. A capability declares which
> kinds it reads and which fact groups it needs, and the platform invokes it only when those
> groups were read — so a capability never sees an unread group and never branches on what woke it.

## 1. The two shapes

```ts
/** What woke the platform. Metadata a capability may log, never branch on. */
export type Trigger = { readonly kind: "event"; readonly event: string } | { readonly kind: "sweep" };

/** A group the producer did not read. A capability that declared the group never sees this. */
export type Unread = "unread";

export interface IssueFacts {
    readonly kind: "issue";
    readonly repository: RepositoryRef;
    readonly item: ItemRef;
    readonly observedAt: Date;
    readonly trigger: Trigger;
    /** Who opened it. Never a group: every producer can read it. */
    readonly author: string;
    /** Who caused this record, or `null` on a sweep. Never a group either. */
    readonly actor: { readonly login: string } | null;
    /** The issue transition carried by this observation, or `null` when there is none. */
    readonly arrival:
        | { readonly kind: "opened" }
        | {
              readonly kind: "label";
              readonly change: "added" | "removed";
              readonly meaning: MappableMeaning | null;
              readonly skill: Skill | null;
          }
        | null;
    /** Always read: the projection every gate judges by. */
    readonly position: Projection<IssueMeaning>;
    /** GitHub's discussion lock state — a group every producer reads, seen only when declared. */
    readonly locked: boolean | Unread;
    /** The mapped skill tiers the issue carries — the same. */
    readonly skills: readonly Skill[] | Unread;
    readonly assignees: readonly AssigneeClock[] | Unread;
    readonly links: { readonly openPullRequests: readonly ItemRef[] } | Unread;
}

export interface PullRequestFacts {
    readonly kind: "pullRequest";
    readonly repository: RepositoryRef;
    readonly item: ItemRef;
    readonly observedAt: Date;
    readonly trigger: Trigger;
    readonly author: string;
    readonly actor: { readonly login: string } | null;
    readonly position: Projection<PrMeaning>;
    readonly assignees: readonly AssigneeClock[] | Unread;
    readonly links: { readonly issues: readonly LinkedIssue[] } | Unread;
    readonly review: {
        readonly changesRequested: boolean;
        readonly reapableSince: Date;
        readonly lastCommitAt: Date | null;
    } | Unread;
    /** Has the author offered it for review yet? Its own group: a webhook can read this one. */
    readonly readiness: { readonly draft: boolean } | Unread;
}

export type Facts = IssueFacts | PullRequestFacts;
export const FACT_KINDS = ["issue", "pullRequest"] as const;
export const FACT_GROUPS = ["locked", "skills", "assignees", "links", "review", "readiness"] as const;
```

`AssigneeClock` and `LinkedIssue` (an item with its assignees' clocks) keep their current shapes.

**Readable and visible are two questions.** Whether a producer CAN read a field is the producer's
row; whether a capability SEES it is its declaration (D211). `locked` and `skills` are read by every
issue producer, off the payload or the list, and are still groups: a capability that did not declare
them has no business branching on them, and `FactsFor` types them `Unread` for it. The base a
record always carries is what identifies the observation: `position`, because the safety world is
derived from it; `author`, because an item nobody opened does not exist; `actor`, `null` on a sweep,
which is a fact and not an `Unread`; and, on an issue, `arrival` — the transition this observation
carries, `null` when it carries none, and never a group because a sweep carries none by nature.

**A pull-request record carries no head sha.** Nothing above names one, and no group holds one, so
a capability that needs the commit a pull request currently points at asks a resolver for it — the
adapter is where a head sha is read, and it is read at the moment of asking rather than carried from
whenever the record was made.

**`readiness` is `draft` alone, and it left `review` for a reason.** It is the one readiness fact a
WEBHOOK can read — the payload carries it — while the three facts remaining in `review` need the
timeline. A capability wanting only draft state would otherwise have to declare `review` and be
skipped `factsUnread` on every delivery it was triggered by.

## 2. What a producer reads

The producers are a registry — `PRODUCERS` in `packages/core/src/capability/producers.ts`, read off
each group module's own row in `packages/core/src/capability/groups/` (D215) — and this table is
generated from it by `pnpm contracts`. One row per producer and per kind it makes a
record of; `—` is a group that kind does not carry.

<!-- generated: producers -->
| Producer | Kind | position | locked | skills | assignees | links | review | readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `issues` | `issue` | read | read | read | unread | unread | — | — |
| `issue_comment` | `issue` | read | read | read | unread | unread | — | — |
| `pull_request` | `pullRequest` | read | — | — | unread | unread | unread | read |
| `sweep` | `issue` | read | read | read | read | read | — | — |
| `sweep` | `pullRequest` | read | — | — | read | read | read | read |
<!-- /generated -->

A producer marks a group unread rather than inventing a value: an empty assignee list from a
webhook would be a lie the safety world cannot tell from a fact. Any future producer that reads
more than the projection says so by filling the group — and by adding its row here first, because
the row is what a declaration is judged against.

**The row is the promise; the record is the day's fact.** A read that failed, and a read the
endpoint-permission matrix has not confirmed, both leave their group unread on a record its row
says `read`. No row falls short that way today — the sweep's `review` was the standing example and
protocol 6.9 cited its three reads (`design/guides/sweep.md` §4) — and the `factsUnread` skip stays
anyway: the boot check refuses a capability that could never run, and the skip covers the record
that falls short of what was promised, whichever of the two reasons put it there.

## 3. What a capability declares

```ts
declareCapability({
    name: "inactivity",
    facts: ["issue", "pullRequest"],                              // the kinds it reads
    needs: {                                                      // the groups it reads, per kind
        issue: ["assignees", "links"],
        pullRequest: ["assignees", "review", "readiness"],
    },
    // triggers, settings, requiredMappings, resolvers, intents as before
});
```

- `needs` is per kind (D214). One list is the shorter form: each group reaches every declared kind
  that carries it. A need on a kind the capability does not declare, or a group that kind does not
  carry — `review` on an issue — is a declaration error at boot; written per kind it does not
  compile.
- A need must also be READ by the producer each declared trigger names — an event names the webhook
  producer of that event, a schedule names the sweep. `needs: ["review"]` on a `pull_request`
  trigger is refused at boot, because the webhook reads no group and the capability would be
  skipped on every delivery instead. The refusal names the trigger, the group, and the producers
  that do read it.
- The view a capability receives is `FactsFor<D>`: the declared kinds, each with its own needed
  groups' `| Unread` removed. The type is the guarantee — `"unread"` cannot reach a capability that
  declared the group, and a capability that did not declare a group cannot read it (the group is
  typed `Unread` for it, which nothing can do anything with).

## 4. What the engine does

- `decide()` takes one fact record, or a delivery that `normalize/` turns into one. A sweep hands
  the engine one record per item; it does not batch, so a decision is about one item and the
  projection for every intent is the record's own.
- For each enabled capability: skip unless `declaration.facts` includes the record's kind; then,
  for each group in the record's kind's `needs`, if the record holds `"unread"`, record
  `factsUnread` (an `info` finding naming the capability and the group) and skip. Otherwise invoke.
- The engine's own world derivation reads `position` only. Nothing else in core reads a group.

## 5. What this replaces

`issueUpdated`, `pullRequestUpdated`, `staleIssuesDue`, `stalePullRequestsDue` — two shapes for the
same issue and two for the same pull request, with the sweep pair carrying a list the engine had
to project per entry. The declaration's `observations` field becomes `facts`; the catalogue's
observation table becomes the two shapes above and the producer table.

## 6. Declined

- **Per-group timestamps** (when each group was read): declined — a producer reads the record at
  one instant, `observedAt`; reopen if a producer ever mixes cached and fresh groups.
- **A `Trigger` a capability may branch on**: declined by type — it is there for reports and for
  the idempotency occasion, and a capability that behaved differently on a sweep than on an event
  would be deciding from the platform's schedule rather than from the item's facts.
