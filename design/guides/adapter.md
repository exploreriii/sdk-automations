# The read-only adapter

> **Not built — build guide.** The first component that talks to GitHub at runtime. It lands behind
> seams that already exist on `main`, so the shell does not change. How the work divides is below;
> its order and estimates live on issue #111, not here.

## Ground rules

| Rule | Consequence |
|---|---|
| The shell does not change | Everything lands behind the four seams |
| Nothing throws across a seam | Every failure is a typed value |
| Unknown is never absence (D51) | A failed read must never become a default |
| Core stays pure | A new package; core adds only `classifyFailure` |
| Fail closed on identity | Config fetches pin the default branch |

- The final shell diff across the whole sequence is one composition-root conditional.
- Typed failures are why one bad delivery can never wedge the queue.
- The contents API serves fork-authored content at a PR head sha (observed, 6.6).

## Auth

| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| JWT | The private key signs a ~10-minute JWT (`node:crypto`, no library) |
| Installation token | `POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens`, valid 1 hour |
| `TokenSource` | Cached, refreshed early, single-flight |
| Expiry | Locally expiry-aware, clock-injected |
| Credentials | `APP_ID`, `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `INSTALLATION_ID` |

- Single-flight means concurrent requests never stampede the mint endpoint.
- An expired token and a wrong key return the byte-identical 401 `"Bad credentials"`.
- Only a local `expires_at` separates them, so `classifyFailure` takes `tokenPastExpiry` as an input.
- Tests drive expiry with a fake clock, and no test touches the network.
- Credentials are untracked environment only — the lab's rule, extended as D99 predicted.

## HTTP client

| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Request shaping | Auth header, API version, timeout via `AbortSignal` |
| Conditional reads | ETag cache per URL; a 304 costs zero quota |
| Rate awareness | Track `x-ratelimit-*` on every response |
| Classification | Non-success builds a `FailureObservation` for core |
| Bounded retry | One retry, and only for two classes |

- One function every operation calls, owning those five concerns.
- A free 304 is how the Q10 budget stays comfortable.
- Classification calls core's `classifyFailure` — no parallel vocabulary.
- Retry: `tokenExpired` refreshes and retries once · `transient` retries once · the rest return at once.
- `secondaryLimit` is **never** auto-retried: it carries no wait signal at all.
- Its tests replay every row of the failure catalogue, whose body snapshots are the fixtures —
  [`../findings/endpoint-permission-matrix.md`](../findings/endpoint-permission-matrix.md).

## Operations

| Function | Endpoint | Fills | Matrix status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fetchConfigFile(ref)` | `GET …/contents/{path}` | `ConfigSource` | confirmed |
| `fetchInstallationGrants()` | token mint response | `installationGrants` | confirmed |
| `readIssueTimeline(n)` | `GET …/issues/{n}/timeline` | `latestHumanChangeAt` | confirmed |
| `readLinkedIssues(pr)` | GraphQL `closingIssuesReferences` | `resolve: linkedIssues` | **untested** |

- **The untested read gets a lab protocol before it gets trust.**
- No matrix row, no citation — and a row without a citation is a guess.
- Manual links, cross-repository references and quota cost go to `packages/dev/lab/protocols/`.
- The answers become matrix rows in [`../findings/`](../findings/); only then does the resolver ship.
- **GitHub ids exceed 2^53**, so every id stays a string.
- **404 means "not found *or* not installed"** — it maps to `notFoundOrNotInstalled`, never to a
  confident absence.

## The seams, once implemented

- **`githubConfigSource`** — fetches at the default branch; `revision` is the blob sha.
- A 404 maps to the absent-file default, matching `fileConfigSource`'s semantics exactly.
- **`liveExternals`** — the real grant list, and `latestHumanChangeAt` from the timeline.
- It answers **unknown** when evidence cannot be established within budget.
- That is the moment dry-run stops overstating. `killSwitchActive` stays operator environment.
- **`linkedIssuesResolver`** — an empty answer and a failed answer are different values.
- Wiring: with the three credential variables present, `main.ts` composes live implementations.
- Without them it composes stubs. One conditional — the sandbox runs live, CI stays credential-free.

## The fail-honest read

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["read(pr)<br/>processor asks"] --> Q["one GraphQL query<br/>closing references"]
    Q -->|200| OK["present / absent<br/>a confident answer"]
    Q -->|"everything else"| UNK["unknown + reason<br/>any failure at all"]
```

- Rate limit, 403, timeout, malformed response — all become `unknown` with a reason.
- The decision layer refuses to act on unknown, so a failed read can never fake a fact.

## How the work divides

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["auth kernel<br/>token cache, fake clock"] --> B["http client<br/>ETags, classification, retry"]
    B --> C["config seam<br/>live ConfigSource"]
    B --> E["resolvers<br/>linked issues, timeline"]
    D["lab protocol<br/>evidence only"] -.-> E
    C --> F["rehearsal<br/>stubs removed"]
    E --> F
```

Four properties make each piece mergeable alone — consequences of the seams, not of a plan.

| Property | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Each piece lands behind an existing seam | The shell never changes |
| The composition root is environment-gated | An unfinished adapter cannot break CI |
| The measurement is its own piece, no code | Evidence merges as protocol and matrix rows |
| Removing the stubs is the last piece | Zero stubs closes the work |

- Credentials present composes live implementations; absent composes stubs.
- CI never holds a credential, and the runnable sandbox keeps working.
- `readLinkedIssues` needs a lab protocol before it earns trust.
- Zero stubs is the done-when below, not a step toward it.

## Verification

| Layer | Runs | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| Unit and fixture tests | CI, no credentials | Auth edges, ETags, all catalogue rows classify |
| Mutation gate | CI | The adapter's Stryker range, pinned to end-of-file |
| Lab conformance | Sandbox, manual | Linked-issue semantics; D40's prose-snapshot re-probe |
| Sandbox rehearsal | Sandbox, live | Zero stubs; dry-run reports stop overstating |

## Done when

- The sandbox rehearsal runs with **zero stubs** — live config, grants, timeline, linked-issue reads.
- Dry-run reports stop overstating, recorded in a register row.
- CI never needed a credential; the lab never tracked one.
- The shell diff across the whole sequence is the composition root only.
- Every GitHub assumption carries a citation — an existing matrix row, or a new one this work produced.
