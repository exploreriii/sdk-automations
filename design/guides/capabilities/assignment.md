# assignment — let a contributor claim work, and release it again

`/assign` claims an issue for the commenter; `/unassign` releases their own claim. Optional skill
gates make the ladder self-service: a tier's issues can be claimed only after completing enough of
the tier below.

Every refusal is explained; a person using GitHub's native assignment controls is never fought —
they have team permissions. Commands gate everyone alike, whatever their role: a team member with
triage or higher never needs `/assign`, because GitHub's own assignee control is their ungated
path — the command exists for contributors GitHub will not let assign themselves.

Every guard is a meaning-set or a number, so different repositories express different policies
with the same schema. An unknown answer refuses politely — never assigns, never releases.

## What the output looks like

Claim accepted:

> ✅ @alice you are assigned to this issue — thank you for picking it up. Comment `/unassign` if
> you need to step away.

Claim refused — at the cap:

> Hi @alice — you already have 2 open assignments, which is this repository's limit.

Claim refused — skill gate:

> Hi @alice — this is an **intermediate** issue, which unlocks after 3 completed **beginner**
> issues (you have 1).

Already claimed:

> Hi @alice — this issue is already assigned to @bob so cannot be claimed.

Release:

> @alice has been unassigned from this issue at their request. The issue is open for anyone to
> pick up.

## What the config looks like

A config enabling auto-assign and unassign with some guards but no skill progression:
```yaml
capabilities:
  assignment:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      autoAssign: # the /assign command
        enabled: true
        maxOpen: 2 # default cap; 0 = uncapped
        maxPerDay: 1 # claims per person per day
        minAccountAgeDays: 7 # refuses brand-new accounts
      unassign: # the self /unassign command
        enabled: true
      skillGates:
        enabled: false

mappings:
  commands:
    assign: "/assign"
    unassign: "/unassign"
```

A config enabling auto-assignment only to issues marked as `status: ready for dev`, within their relevant skill level, with assignment caps only applying to assignments not in `status: needs review`.

```yaml
capabilities:
  assignment:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      autoAssign: # the /assign command
        enabled: true
        claimableOnlyWhen: [ready] # empty = any open issue
        notClaimableWhen: [blocked, awaitingTriage, inProgress]
        maxOpen: 2 # default cap; 0 = uncapped
        capIgnores: [needsReview, blocked] # assignments in these states do not count — review waits and blocks are not the contributor's fault
        maxPerDay: 1 # claims per person per day
        minAccountAgeDays: 7 # refuses brand-new accounts
      unassign: # the self /unassign command
        enabled: true
      skillGates:
        enabled: true
        goodFirstIssue:
          maxCompletions: 2 # after this many, GFIs are for newer contributors
        beginner:
          requiresPrevious: 1 # completed goodFirstIssue issues
        intermediate:
          requiresPrevious: 3
        advanced:
          requiresPrevious: 10

mappings:
  labels:
    ready: "status: ready for dev"
    blocked: "status: blocked"
    awaitingTriage: "status: needs triage"
    inProgress: "status: in development"
    needsReview: "status: needs review"
  skills: # required when skillGates is enabled; the ladder order is fixed
    goodFirstIssue: "skill: good first issue"
    beginner: "skill: beginner"
    intermediate: "skill: intermediate"
    advanced: "skill: advanced"
  commands:
    assign: "/assign"
    unassign: "/unassign"
```

A config where any open issue is claimable, guarding by progression:

```yaml
capabilities:
  assignment:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      autoAssign:
        enabled: true
        claimableOnlyWhen: [] # any open issue
        notClaimableWhen: [blocked]
        maxOpen: 3
      unassign:
        enabled: true
      skillGates:
        enabled: true
        goodFirstIssue:
          maxOpen: 1 # tier override of the cap
          maxCompletions: 2
        beginner:
          requiresPrevious: 1
        intermediate:
          requiresPrevious: 5
        advanced:
          requiresPrevious: 10
```

Completions are counted in this repository: closed issues carrying the tier's skill label that the
contributor was assigned to. An issue with no skill label is gated only by the cap. An issue with
two skill labels resolves to the higher tier.

```

Native GitHub assignment is a valid manual
decision: the capability observes it and never counter-writes — a maintainer assigning someone
bypasses every gate on purpose. 

## Phases

| Phase | Ships | Needs first |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/assign` + `/unassign`, claimability meanings, the caps | the command observation + actor model (vocabulary PR) · the assignee write family (shared with inactivity) · an open-assignments count resolver that carries each assignment's meanings (for `capIgnores` and per-tier caps) |
| 2 | skill gates · `maxPerDay` · `minAccountAgeDays` · `reclaimCooldownDays` | the `skills` mapping family (the D127 reader, third instantiation) · a completed-count-by-skill resolver, repo-local · recent-claim times and App-release events (timeline reads, or the durable-state candidate) · account age on the actor |
| 3 | position pairing — claim writes `inProgress`, release writes `ready`, when those meanings are mapped | the two-write recovery record (§operational needs); the `ready`-ownership conversation with intake |
| 4 (candidate) | recognition and next-issue recommendation on merge — the rest of old `progression` | demand evidence first; unranked |

## Declaration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `triggers` | `issue_comment` (created — an edited comment is never executed) · `issues` (assigned, unassigned; observe-only, for later position sync) |
| `observations` | `commandIssued` (new — the commands vocabulary PR) |
| `resolvers` | `isAutomationActor` (exists) · open-assignments with meanings (new) · completed-count by skill (new, phase 2) · recent-claim times, account age, and App-release events for one item (new, phase 2) |
| `intents` | `postManagedComment` · `assign` (new — the assignee write family) · `unassign` (same family) · `applyMappedLabel` (phase 3) |
| Permissions | repository: `issues:read`, `pull_requests:read` (the `capIgnores` look at linked PRs), `issues:write` · organization: none — counting stays in this repository |
| `operationalNeeds` | schedule: false · durableState: candidate — `maxPerDay` if the timeline read proves too costly, and phase 3's assignee+label pair (two GitHub calls; a crash between them needs a record, never a guess from the label-and-assignee shape) · crossItemCoordination: true — the caps count across issues · externalDelivery: false |

## Never

| Never | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Fight a native assignment or unassignment | the `issues` events are observe-only; no counter-write exists |
| Release anyone but the commenter | the release command is self-only by definition; releasing others is the maintainers' native control, and reaping is inactivity's own declared `unassign` — no capability names a sibling (P3) |
| Exempt any role from a gate | no permission-reading resolver exists, on purpose — the native UI is every team member's bypass |
| Assign on an unknown answer | unknown is never "under the cap" (D51) |
| Execute an edited comment, or a command in a PR comment | the trigger is `created` only; the item kind refuses PRs |
| Count caps or completions across repositories | repo-local by declaration; the org-wide cap is the parked ceiling question (D57) |
| Close, lock, or label-moderate an issue | absent from `intents` (D61) |

## Verified by

| Scenario | Proves |
|---|---|
| `/assign` on an open, claimable, in-gate issue | assigned, one welcome comment |
| `/assign` on an issue without the `claimableOnlyWhen` meaning | refused with the fix — C++'s ready-for-dev rule, expressed as config |
| At the cap, but one assignment sits in `needsReview` | the claim succeeds — `capIgnores` skipped it |
| Assigned to a `blocked` issue, `blocked` in `capIgnores` | does not count toward the cap; remove it from the set and it does — the meaning-set decides |
| Maintainer natively assigns someone past the cap | it counts; their next `/assign` is refused — native bypasses the gates, never the arithmetic |
| At a tier's `maxOpen`, under the default cap | refused — the tier override governs |
| Issue closed as not-planned | not a completion; the gate count is unchanged |
| Skill or block label added after a claim | nothing — gates run at claim time, and this capability never releases |
| Issue carrying both `ready` and `blocked` | not claimable — deny wins |
| `/unassign` then `/assign` the same day | `maxPerDay` counts the earlier claim; releasing is not a refund |
| Second `/assign` by the same person, same occasion | no duplicate comment — managed identity |
| Two contributors race `/assign` | one wins; the loser gets the already-claimed comment — apply-time re-check |
| `/assign` by a bot | nothing — `isAutomationActor` |
| `/assign` in a PR comment | nothing — claims are issue claims |
| `/assign` from a 2-day-old account, `minAccountAgeDays: 7` | refused, naming the age rule |
| Reaped for inactivity, `/assign` the same issue next day | refused for `reclaimCooldownDays` — a different issue claims fine |
| Count resolver fails or paginates incompletely | polite refusal, never an assignment (unknown ≠ under the cap) |
| Skill-unlabelled issue | caps apply, the gate does not |
| Maintainer assigns via the UI over every gate | untouched — no counter-write |
| `/unassign` by a non-assignee | explained, nothing released |
| Released by inactivity, then `/assign` again | a fresh claim; the capabilities compose without naming each other |
| Missing `issues:write` | `forbidden`, not retried |
| `mode: dry-run` | the exact assign/unassign named as `wouldApply`; nothing written |
