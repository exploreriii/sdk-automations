# Configuration reference

The App is controlled by `automations.yml` in your repository root. With App credentials, the shell
reads the file from the repository's default branch. Credential-free development and CI can use an
operator-maintained local copy through `CONFIG_FILE`. This page defines every shared key the parser
accepts today.

*The test suite locks this page's closed vocabularies—top-level keys, modes, meanings, and rejection
codes—against the code on every commit. Explanatory behavior still requires review.*

## The file at a glance

5 top-level keys and two shared wrapper levels. The tree below is the entire shared shape; what a
capability writes inside its own block is deliberately capability-owned and may be deeper:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1              # ── top level. Optional, default: 1
mode: dry-run                 # ── top level. Optional, default: observe

capabilities:                 # ── top level. Optional, default: nothing enabled
  intake:                     #    └─ one block per capability, keyed by its name
    enabled: true             #       └─ boolean, default: false
    announce: true            #       └─ that capability's own options, keys defined by it

mappings:                     # ── top level. Optional, default: no meanings available
  labels:                     #    └─ one of four families that may appear under mappings
    awaitingTriage: "status: triage"    # └─ one line per meaning: your label name
    ready: "status: ready for dev"
  commands:                   #    └─ the words contributors type
    assign: "/assign"
  skills:                     #    └─ the difficulty ladder, as labels
    goodFirstIssue: "good first issue"
  alerts:                     #    └─ YOUR alert names, each carried by a label
    p0: "P0-🔥"

principals:                   # ── top level. Optional, default: none
  maintainerTeam: "hiero-sdk-js-maintainers"    # └─ one line per role: a single name
```

Two things that prevent most mistakes:

- In headings below, dots mean **nesting**, not key names: `capabilities.<name>.enabled` is the
  `enabled` line inside one capability's block, three levels deep.
- Any shared key not on this tree is an error. Inside a capability's block the names beside
  `enabled` are checked against the capability's own declaration; the values are not, and stay the
  capability's business.

Nothing is required. Every default is non-writing—an empty file is valid and produces an `observe`
decision rather than an active effect.

## Key definitions

### `schemaVersion`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | integer |
| Required | no |
| Default | `1` |
| Allowed | `1` |

Leave it out and the file is version 1. State it and it must be the unquoted number `1`: `"1"` is a
string and is rejected, and so is `schemaVersion:` with nothing after it. A future format will have
to say `schemaVersion: 2`, so no file can drift into a newer version by accident. There is no version
2 yet, and the migration/deprecation policy for any future version remains deliberately undecided.

### `mode`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | string |
| Required | no |
| Default | `observe` |
| Allowed | `disabled`, `observe`, `dry-run`, `active` |

Core recognizes all four values. Whether `active` is honoured depends on the composition the endpoint
was started as: one that wires no write path — the shipped default — rejects it before a decision and
records `modeUnsupported`, explained in
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#it-never-got-as-far-as-deciding). Values are case-sensitive, and
unquoted `no` is a YAML boolean rather than a mode — quote anything you are unsure of.

| Mode | Reads | Reports | Records what it would do | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `disabled` | yes | findings plus `modeDisabled` refusals | no | no |
| `observe` | yes | yes | yes—record-only | no |
| `dry-run` | yes | yes | yes—record-only, plus a `wouldApply` line naming each change | no |
| `active` | configuration only | unsupported-mode rejection | no | no |

Enabled capabilities and their declared resolvers run before the mode verdict, including in `disabled`.
`observe` and `dry-run` refuse identically; the difference is what they say. For every effect that
reaches the mode rule, `dry-run` adds one `wouldApply` finding naming the capability, the operation,
the item and the exact change — a rehearsal to read before promoting a repository to `active`. An
effect an earlier rule refused is never rehearsed, and nothing is prepared: no comment marker is
minted for a write that will not happen.

`active` is rejected before a decision by any composition that wires no write path, which is the
shipped default. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#it-never-got-as-far-as-deciding).

`mode:` with no value after it is an error, not a default — the App will not pick a mode for you.

### `capabilities`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | mapping of capability name → that capability's block |
| Required | no |
| Default | `{}` — nothing enabled |

Keys are capability names in camelCase (`intake`, `prQuality`). Every name must belong to the
application's directly admitted capability list, whether `enabled` is `true` or `false`. Unknown
names fail closed instead of being retained as compatibility entries.

### `capabilities.<name>.enabled`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | boolean |
| Required | no |
| Default | `false` |

Must be a real boolean. `"true"` in quotes, `yes`, and `1` are all errors — being switched on is
consent, and consent is not inferred from anything that merely looks true.

### `capabilities.<name>.<key>`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | whatever that setting declares — a boolean, a number, a list, or a block of its own |
| Required | no |
| Default | the capability's documented value for that key |

A capability's own options sit beside its `enabled`, on the same level; there is no wrapper between
them. Every capability declares which setting names it reads, and a name outside
that list is an `unknownKey` error naming the exact path — so `annouce:` fails instead of configuring
nothing, and so does a `settings:` line left over from the older shape. Disabled blocks are checked
too: a typo that waits for the day you flip `enabled` is the surprise this rule exists to end.

Names AND values, in one pass. The same declaration says what each setting may hold, so a number where a
boolean belongs, or a clock that reaps before it reminds, is a `settingInvalid` error naming the exact
path — checked with the rest of the file, before anything runs. A value you leave out takes the
capability's documented default. The keys each capability reads are listed on
[capabilities](capabilities.md).

Each capability only ever sees its own block — the keys beside its own `enabled`, and nothing
another capability was given.

**A clock is a duration, written as a whole number with a unit.** `4h` and `14d` are clocks; `14`
is not, and neither are `2w`, `90m` or `1d4h` — the App refuses a bare number with the spelling it
should have had. One day is twenty-four hours, the shortest wait before anything is released or
closed is two hours, and the longest clock of any kind is `36500d`, a century.

**What `0` means is per key, and the key's own sentence says it.** There is no global rule: for one
setting `0h` is "immediately" (`remindAfter: 0h` warns on the first sweep that sees the item), for
another `0` is "uncapped", and for another it is "nobody". The sentence beside each key on
[capabilities](capabilities.md) is where that is written, and where a key's sentence says nothing
about zero, zero is simply the number.

### Making two capabilities work together

**The label vocabulary is the only channel there is.** Capabilities cannot read each other's blocks,
call each other, or run in an order you choose — that isolation is deliberate, and it is what lets
you enable one without reasoning about the rest. What one capability *writes* another can *read*,
because both speak the same meanings: `prQuality` applies your `needsRevision` label to a pull
request that is failing its checks, and `inactivity`'s `reapWhen.needsRevision` is a clock that runs
on pull requests carrying it. Wire that up by mapping the meaning once under `mappings.labels` and
naming it in both blocks. Everything else — settings, timing, comments — stays isolated by design,
so if you are looking for a way to make one capability wait for another, there is not one.

### `mappings`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | mapping with up to four keys: `labels`, `commands`, `skills`, `alerts` |
| Required | no |
| Default | `{}` — no meanings available |

See [Label mappings](#label-mappings) below, then [Command mappings](#command-mappings),
[Skill mappings](#skill-mappings) and [Alerts](#alerts).

### `principals`

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | mapping of role name → a single name, as a string |
| Required | no |
| Default | `{}` |

Named people or teams a capability can refer to without hard-coding them. Each value is a single
non-empty string — a list is an error, and so is an empty name: a capability that addresses a
principal writes `@` in front of whatever you put here, so a blank one would ping nobody and say
nothing about it. A bare login and an `org/team` slug are both fine; the App does not check which
you wrote.

## Label mappings

**Why this exists.** The App thinks in fixed meanings: `needsReview` is the same idea in every
repository. Your repository has its own words for it — `status: needs review`, `S-review`, `awaiting
review`. This mapping is the translation between the two, and it runs in one direction only: a
capability asks for a *meaning*, and the App looks up *your* label.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The App can only touch labels you list here.** A label you have not mapped is invisible to it. This
  is the main lever you have over its blast radius, and it is why the mapping is explicit rather than
  guessed from your label names.
- **Renaming a label is a one-line change here**, not a change to any capability.

### Do I have to map all of them?

No. **It depends on which capabilities you enable** — each one uses only the meanings it needs.

You are told in this file, not later in a report. Every capability declares the meanings it requires, and
enabling one whose meaning you have not mapped is a `meaningRequired` error naming the capability, the
meaning, and the line to add. A capability you leave disabled requires nothing.

Capabilities still skip themselves at report time when a meaning is missing, but that path is now only
reachable for a configuration the parser never saw — it is a safety net, not the thing you find out from.

Map nothing, enable nothing, and the App writes no labels at all — which is a legitimate way to run it.

| Meaning | Typical use |
|---|---|
| `awaitingTriage` | New, nobody has looked yet |
| `ready` | Triaged and available to pick up |
| `inProgress` | Someone is on it |
| `needsReview` | Waiting on a reviewer |
| `needsRevision` | Reviewer sent it back |
| `readyToMerge` | Approved, awaiting merge |
| `blocked` | Paused by a human — the App reads this and never sets it |

Rules: a label must be a non-empty string, and no two meanings may share one. The duplicate check
ignores case and surrounding spaces, but the label is otherwise used **exactly as written** — it has
to match your real GitHub label character for character.

## Command mappings

The same translation, for the words a contributor types in a comment. The App knows three acts; your
repository chooses what each is called, so a project already telling people to write `/take` keeps
saying `/take`.

```yaml
mappings:
  commands:
    assign: "/assign"       # claim an issue
    unassign: "/unassign"   # give it back
    working: "/working"     # "still on it" — resets the inactivity clock
```

Rules: a command must be a non-empty string **starting with `/`**, and no two acts may share one. As
with labels, the duplicate check ignores case and surrounding spaces, because a comment typed
`/Assign` is the same instruction as `/assign`. A bare word is rejected rather than silently given a
slash — a command nobody can type is worse than an error.

Map nothing here and no command works. An unmapped act is invisible, exactly as an unmapped label is.

## Skill mappings

The difficulty ladder, as labels. Four tiers, easiest first — the **order is fixed**, and it is what
"at least beginner" means to a capability that gates on tiers.

```yaml
mappings:
  skills:
    goodFirstIssue: "good first issue"
    beginner: "skill: beginner"
    intermediate: "skill: intermediate"
    advanced: "skill: advanced"
```

Rules: the same as labels — a non-empty string, no two tiers sharing one, duplicates judged ignoring
case and surrounding spaces. One rule more: **a label cannot be both a tier and a meaning.** Tiers and
meanings are both real GitHub labels, so `status: ready` cannot appear under both `labels` and
`skills`; the App would have no way to read it back.

## Alerts

The three families above are **closed**: the App names the meanings and you choose the words. This
one is **open** — you name the meanings as well, because an alert has no meaning to the App beyond
"a capability's settings may refer to it".

```yaml
mappings:
  alerts:                     # you invent these names
    p0: "P0-🔥"
    security: "Security"
```

Three things worth knowing:

- **An entry is a label, written exactly as the three closed families write theirs.** Alert names are
  camelCase like every other key, and the same rules apply to the label: a non-empty string, no two
  alerts sharing one, duplicates judged ignoring case and surrounding spaces.
- **The names are yours, so nothing can require one.** A capability may say "notify this principal
  about `p0`", and if you never mapped `p0` that setting is reported as an error naming the alert.
- **The one label namespace still holds.** An alert label cannot also be a position or a tier: the
  App would have no way to read it back. This family is read last, so the label you are told to
  change is the one under `alerts`.

## Rules that may surprise you

- **Any error rejects the whole file.** The shell stores one `configRejected` record, completes the
  delivery, and never evaluates capabilities with a partial or no-config fallback. Every error is reported
  at once, not one per push.
- **Unknown keys are errors, not ignored.** A typo like `capabilties:` fails loudly, and so does a
  setting the capability never declared. Setting *values* remain the capability's own business.
- **An empty file, or no file, means `observe`.** Never `active`.
- **Duplicate keys are errors.** YAML would otherwise keep the last value silently — the one case
  where a typo could change your mode while the file still looks right.

## Every way the file can be wrong

The exact codes the App reports, and what to fix.

| Code | What it means |
|---|---|
| `documentUnparseable` | The YAML itself is broken; the message names the line and column |
| `duplicateKey` | The same key appears twice; delete one |
| `notAMapping` | Something is a list or a bare value where `key: value` pairs belong |
| `unknownKey` | A key the schema does not have — usually a typo. Includes a setting name the capability never declared |
| `schemaVersionUnsupported` | A stated `schemaVersion` is not the unquoted number `1` — omit the key and it is `1` |
| `modeInvalid` | `mode` is not one of the four modes (check case and quoting) |
| `capabilityNameInvalid` | Capability names are camelCase, like `prQuality` |
| `capabilityEnabledNotBoolean` | `enabled` must be literally `true` or `false` — not `"true"`, not `1` |
| `capabilityUnknown` | The capability is not available in this application; remove its block or run an application that ships it |
| `settingInvalid` | A value in a capability's block is not what that setting takes — the message names the path and what it must be |
| `meaningNotMappable` | A key under `mappings.labels` is not in the meanings table above |
| `meaningRequired` | An enabled capability needs a mapping you have not made; the message names the line to add |
| `labelInvalid` | A label that is empty, only spaces, or not a string |
| `labelNotInjective` | Two meanings map to the same label; give one a different name |
| `commandNotMappable` | A key under `mappings.commands` is not one of `assign`, `unassign`, `working` |
| `commandInvalid` | A command that is empty, not a string, or does not start with `/` |
| `commandNotInjective` | Two acts map to the same word; give one a different one |
| `skillNotMappable` | A key under `mappings.skills` is not one of the four tiers |
| `skillInvalid` | A tier label that is empty, only spaces, or not a string |
| `skillNotInjective` | Two tiers share a label, or a tier uses a label `mappings.labels` already claims |
| `alertInvalid` | An alert name that is not camelCase, or a label that is empty, only spaces, or not a string |
| `alertNotInjective` | Two alerts share a label, or an alert uses a label another family already claims |
| `principalNameInvalid` | A principal name is not camelCase, like `maintainerTeam` |
| `principalNotAString` | A principal must be a single non-empty name, as a string |
