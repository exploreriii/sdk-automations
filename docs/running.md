# Running the shell

> The App is in development and not yet installable. These pages describe the configuration it ships with.

For whoever runs the endpoint: what it reads from the environment, what arms each lane, the two
switches, and the commands that ask it what happened.

## Start it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @hiero-hackers/automation-runtime start
```

It drains the deliveries already in the store before it listens. `GET /healthz` answers `200 ok` for
a liveness probe; every other GET is 405. After that, everything the process does is one JSON line
per event — `at`, `event` from a closed vocabulary, and that event's own fields, with `deliveryId` on
every line about one delivery, so `grep` on a GUID returns its whole passage. Lines an operator
should notice go to stderr and the rest to stdout. A refusal to boot is the exception and stays a
human sentence: it precedes the process being alive, and has no delivery to name. Node prints an
`ExperimentalWarning` for its SQLite module; it is not an error.

## The environment

```
WEBHOOK_SECRET=…            # the App's webhook secret
REPO_OWNER=owner-sandbox    # required without App credentials: the repository the local file serves
REPO_NAME=automation-sandbox
APP_ID=…                    # optional App credentials; provide all three together
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=…
INSTALLATION_ID=…
APP_SLUG=…                  # optional; the App's URL slug. Arms the write path
PORT=8790                   # optional
HOST=127.0.0.1              # optional; omit to use Node's default bind host
CONFIG_FILE=…               # credential-free fallback; default <state home>/automations.yml
STORE_PATH=…                # optional; default <state home>/shell.sqlite
TICK_SECONDS=60             # optional; the reconciliation tick: requeue, recover, drain, fire
SWEEP_CADENCE_HOURS=1       # optional; arms the fact sweep and sets how often a repository is read
SWEEP_WRITE_CAP=20          # optional; how many writes one sweep firing may send
SWEEP_READ_BUDGET=2000      # optional; how many requests one sweep firing may spend reading
KILL_SWITCH=1               # optional; refuse everything, loudly — including armed writes
SUSPENDED=1                 # optional; accept every delivery, decide and send nothing
XDG_STATE_HOME=…            # optional; where the state home lives
```

The three credentials are required together, and a key file that is not there fails the boot before
the process listens. Without them the shell reads a local configuration file and stubbed external
facts, which is CI's permanent path — and dry-run reports on that path **overstate** what an armed
endpoint would apply, because an ordering nobody could read is not a conflict.

## What arms writes, and what arms the sweep

**`APP_SLUG` arms the write path, and it is not a fourth credential.** The three credentials buy
reads; writing needs one thing more, because a read-back that cannot tell this App's own comment from
a person's cannot recognise what it wrote — the check that stops a duplicate comment and stops the
platform editing someone else's writing. The slug becomes the bot login `<slug>[bot]`, and `APP_ID`
supplies the other half of that identity. Credentials with no slug boot as they do today; a slug with
no credentials, or one that cannot spell a login (empty, spaced, bracketed), fails closed before the
process listens.

**`SWEEP_CADENCE_HOURS` is the same shape for the other lane.** Absent, this process reads a
repository only when GitHub speaks first, and a capability that runs on a clock is configured and
never woken; present, a due schedule row is claimed on the reconciliation tick and becomes one fact
record per open item. It needs the credentials for the reason the slug does — a cadence is an
instruction to read GitHub.

The `startup` line carries `writes: "armed" | "absent"` and `sweep: "armed" | "absent"`, so which
composition is running is readable before any delivery arrives.

One firing sends at most `SWEEP_WRITE_CAP` writes and spends at most `SWEEP_READ_BUDGET` requests
reading, resuming next firing where it stopped. A webhook writes for one item and a firing writes for
every one, which is why the cap is the sweep's: an act it holds back is refused `sweepWriteCap` and
decided again from the same cause next firing, and `sweepFinished` carries `writes` and `heldBack`,
so a repository the cap is starving says so every firing.

## The two switches

- **`KILL_SWITCH=1`** refuses everything at the decision gate, and an armed write path meets it again
  between deciding and applying: the applier re-checks it before every send and before every resend.
- **`SUSPENDED=1`** verifies and accepts every delivery and then finishes it without deciding —
  nothing is read, nothing runs, nothing is sent. A delivery completed this way is not reconsidered
  when the suspension lifts; the next event on the item is decided normally
  ([`installationSuspended`](troubleshooting.md)).

## Where the store lives

The state home is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sdk-automations`, or `~/.local/state/sdk-automations` when that
variable is unset or relative. The store is `shell.sqlite` there unless `STORE_PATH` names another
file, and the credential-free configuration copy is `automations.yml` beside it unless `CONFIG_FILE`
does. It is deliberately outside the package: in a container `packages/runtime/data/` is an image
layer, and a redeploy would take the decision rows with it. That directory is never tracked, and an
operator who points `STORE_PATH` back at it is still writing raw payloads and real repository names.

## Ask it what happened

```bash
pnpm shell:status
pnpm shell:explain <effect-id>
pnpm shell:explain --item issue#40 --repo owner/repo
```

`shell:status` prints what the store can say about the platform now, one line per question;
`shell:explain` prints one effect's facts and where it stands, or one item's effects and decisions.
Both only read, and exit 1 when no store answered. Every code either prints is in
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

## Stop it

`SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, in the order that loses nothing: the socket closes, the tick stops, the pass
already in flight is awaited, then the store. A second signal during a shutdown is ignored. Nothing
is claimed on the way out — work left pending is claimed by the next start.
