/**
 * The one authenticated GitHub call path used by every adapter operation.
 *
 * This file deliberately owns the mechanics that would otherwise drift
 * between operations: request headers, timeouts, the bounded ETag cache, the
 * bounded body read, rate-limit state and the pacing it feeds, refusal of
 * redirects, and how long a failure is waited on before it is handed back.
 * Waiting is this file's job because nothing below it may hold a claimed
 * delivery, and nothing above it can see a `retry-after` (D20).
 *
 * Core owns the vocabulary for GitHub responses and the retry advice for each
 * class. The shapes every operation speaks, and the two results core cannot
 * have, are `contract.ts`. Whether a request may be sent at all is
 * `admission.ts` — the pinned origin, the one admitted GraphQL query, the four
 * write endpoints, and the grants a request needs — and this file is its only
 * caller. Which token to send is `token.ts`.
 *
 * Writes travel this same path behind that gate. What each answer MEANS is
 * `writes.ts`; this file only decides how often an admitted write may be sent
 * again, and what its landing makes untrustworthy in the cache.
 *
 * In order below: the chosen bounds, the retry policy, the representation
 * cache, the client.

     * ends, so two creations never overlap in flight — a burst is what 6.4
     * tripped, and spacing alone would still let a burst leave together.
     *
     * The wait is not retry budget: it happens before anything is sent, so it
     * cannot spend a claim on a failure, and it is bounded by the spacing
     * itself rather than by `MAX_RETRY_WAIT_MS`.
