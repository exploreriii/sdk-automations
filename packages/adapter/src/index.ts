/**
 * The adapter: the only place in the platform that talks to GitHub.
 *
 * See [README.md](README.md) for what it owns, the seams it fills, and why
 * its knowledge goes stale differently from everything else.
 *
 * Named exports, deliberately: the surface is what a composition root
 * composes — the factories, the seam contracts, and the outcome vocabulary.
 * Bounds, windows, and judgement helpers stay inside; a test that needs one
 * imports its module directly.
