/**
 * The pull-request ladder: a pull request whose ball is the contributor's is
 * put on the close ladder. The close is the one act — an intent may only name
 * the record's own item, and a linked issue's assignees are the issue ladder's
 * to release on its own next sweep.
 *
 * ONE intent, and it is the ACT. The reminder is not an intent any more: the
 * close carries its words as grace, and the platform posts them on first
 * sight, records what it promised, and refuses the close until that promise
 * has run out (grace.md §1).
 *
 * The guards run in the order `design.md`'s pull-request flowchart reads its
 * diamonds — the maintainers' wait first, then the mode, then the clock. One
 * record is one pull request (contracts/facts.md §4), so everything judged
 * here arrives on the record or on the context.
