/**

 * The repository check (`packages/dev/checks`) parses the same files, but it

 * would admit every capability with an empty spec and pass in silence. Here
 * the real declarations are objects, carrying the real specs, so an example
 * that reaps before it reminds is refused by the parser the shell runs.
 *
 * Reads the files from the repository root found by walking up, because
