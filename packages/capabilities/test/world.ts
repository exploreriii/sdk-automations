/**
 * What remains of the probe world after D92 3(c): the engine owns the

 * conveniences that were never platform-shaped — a config builder and the
 * smallest-block helper it is built on, the subset enumerator, and the
 * fact-record builders.
 *
 * ONE BUILDER, and it takes a producer: `recordFrom` reads that producer's row
 * in core's `PRODUCERS` and fills exactly the groups the row names, marking the
 * rest `UNREAD`. A suite naming a producer is therefore making the platform's
 * own claim about what that producer reads, and a row that changes moves every
 * fixture with it rather than leaving four hand-written records behind. The
 * four named builders below are thin wrappers, kept because which producer a
 * suite reaches for IS the claim it is making and `recordFrom("sweep", …)`
 * reads no better at a call site than `sweptIssue()`.
