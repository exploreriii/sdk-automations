 * a re-gate can never judge a differently-shaped request than the decision did.
 * `decide.ts` composes; this file only says what a change IS.

 * before promoting the repository to `active` (safety rule 10's rollout half).
 *
 * It DESCRIBES rather than prepares. No managed identity is minted here and
 * none is minted anywhere else in this mode: a marker is the name a landed
 * write is found again under, and a write that will not happen has nothing to
 * find (D125). The change is spelled in `describeChange`'s words, so the
