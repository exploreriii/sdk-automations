/**
 * The guard kit's one helper — `design/guides/capability-kits.md` §2.
 *
 * Three claims, each tested as a claim rather than as a shape: a skip reaches
 * the operator surface exactly once, it goes under the capability's own name
 * with the detail it was handed, and it hands its caller an empty list to
 * return. The other two stops need no helper and so have no test here — a
 * silent stop is `return []` and a refusal is an ordinary intent.
 *
 * The handle here is a fixture, not a capability. `packages/capabilities`
 * tests what each capability's own guards decide.
