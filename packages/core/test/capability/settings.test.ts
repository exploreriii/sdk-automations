/**
 * The settings toolkit — `design/guides/capability-kits.md` §3.
 *
 * Two halves, in the order a reader meets them. The constructors first, each
 * against the rule its row of §3's table states, and then against what it says
 * about itself; then the six capability designs, whose `automations.yml`
 * examples are the fixtures under `fixtures/settings/`. The second half is the
 * acceptance claim: the toolkit is proved against all six designs before the
 * second capability's code exists.
 *
 * The specs below are the DESIGNS' — including for the three capabilities that
 * have code, whose `settings.ts` today declares only the keys the seed reads.
 * A design's spec lives here until its seed is promoted to it.
 *
 * Two things the fixtures show about today's platform rather than about the
 * toolkit, both pinned rather than worked around:
 *
 * - A design's block is an EXCERPT, so it states no `schemaVersion`; the
 *   harness supplies the one line every document needs.
 * - `mappings` holds four families: three CLOSED (`labels`, `commands`,
 *   `skills`) and one OPEN (`alerts`). Every entry is a spelling string, so a
 *   design naming a family the platform does not have — intake's `types:`
 *   block, whose phase table lists it as work to come — is refused as an
 *   unknown key. `travel` records which family refused a document before
 *   reading the settings without it.

     * A role IS an enabled-block, so `roles` stays `blocks`: each role states
     * `enabled`, and a role turned off must not have its pillars read. Its
     * `uncounted` is free display text, which is `texts()`.
     *
     * `pillars` is `closed()` and not `sections()`, and D4 is why. Each pillar
     * carries its OWN parameters — `minTier` is `mergedPRs`'s and `outcome` is
     * `issuesAuthored`'s — so one open-keyed shape for all four would have to
     * admit every parameter on every pillar, and before D4 it admitted them by
     * dropping them in silence. A closed group names the four pillars, gives
     * each its own fields, and reports a fifth at its own path.
     *
     * `oneOf` still has no optional form, and inside `closed()` it does not
     * need one: a member the file never stated reads `null` and its reader
     * never runs. That is what makes `minTier` and `outcome` readable here at
     * last. What `oneOf` cannot do is check a tier against `mappings.skills` —
     * a scalar sibling of `skills()` would, and adding one is a change to §3's
     * table rather than a test's business.
     *
     * The doc's one cross-field rule — `noticeIssue` required by
     * `noticeOn: trackingIssue` — is unread on purpose. §3.3 moves the DESIGN's
     * config to a structural form (a group under the choice that needs it)
     * rather than growing the toolkit a dependency; until then both fields are
     * read flat and the pairing is nobody's rule here.
