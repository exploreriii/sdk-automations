/**
 * A valid configuration, built rather than hand-rolled — the accepting half
 * of what `documents.ts` holds the rejections for.
 *
 * Four suites wrote the same `parseConfig` call: the same document literal,
 * the same throw on the failure arm, differing only in a revision string and
 * one `enabled` flag. Copies that similar drift rather than diverge — two of
 * them were byte-identical, which is a fact nobody could see from inside
 * either file.
 *
 * It sits beside the rejection corpus and not in the testkit because core
 * cannot depend on a package that depends on core; the testkit's own header
 * names config builders as the thing it will not take. Beside `documents.ts`
 * is also where Stryker can see it: the sandbox is the mutated package's own
 * directory, so in-package support is support that survives mutation (D82).
