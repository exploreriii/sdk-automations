/**
 * The normalizer, tested against what GitHub actually sent.
 *
 * The payloads live in the testkit now — two packages needed them, which is
 * this repository's admission rule for shared test support — and they reach
 * this file through its export rather than a path, so they travel into
 * Stryker's sandbox with the dependency. What a delivery BECOMES is this
 * file's subject.
 *
 * Every capture is a real delivery from the 2026-08-07 capture session
 * (protocol 7.1), scrubbed and human-reviewed. No payload here was written
 * by hand, and that is the point: the assumptions worth testing are the ones
 * GitHub gets to falsify.
