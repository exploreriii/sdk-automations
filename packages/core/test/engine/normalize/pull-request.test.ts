/**
 * The pull-request family, tested against what GitHub actually sent.
 *
 * The payloads live in the testkit — two packages needed them, which is this
 * repository's admission rule for shared test support — and they reach this
 * file through its export rather than a path, so they travel into Stryker's
 * sandbox with the dependency. What a `pull_request` delivery BECOMES is
 * this file's subject; the routing and the shared preamble, including the
 * `mergedMissing` refusal's place in the code table, are `events.test.ts`'s.
 *
 * Every capture is a real delivery from the 2026-08-07 capture session
 * (protocol 7.1), scrubbed and human-reviewed. No payload here was written
 * by hand, and that is the point: the assumptions worth testing are the ones
 * GitHub gets to falsify.
