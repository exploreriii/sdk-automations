/**
 * The vertical slice, closed: one delivery GitHub actually sent travels
 * webhook-payload → normalize → capability → screen → safety → report,
 * entirely in pure logic, through `decide()` (D92). Zero network, zero
 * mocks of GitHub — the payload is the testkit's `issues.opened.json` from
 * the 2026-08-07 capture session.
 *
 * Nothing here is synthetic until the capability speaks, which is the whole
 * point: when GitHub changes shape, this is the test that notices first. The
 * second describe is the one exception, and says why.
 *
 * The parity test is the one place the pipeline is still hand-wired: it
 * builds the expected report from the same primitives `decide()` composes
 * — `screenIntent`, `evaluateWrite`, `explanationFinding`, `verdictFinding`
 * — on the identical intent, so that block is the specification `decide()`
 * is held to, not duplicated plumbing (D92 phase 2's parity gate).
 *
 * That block takes the request from `writeRequestFor` — decide()'s one
 * builder, shared with the shell's applier — and the world from
 * `deriveWorld` over a projection rebuilt from the capture's labels. It
 * then pins each of those
 * to today's spelling, because `verdictFinding` surfaces only a code and a
 * reason — a report comparison alone would let the target format, the change
 * description or the world derivation drift unnoticed.
