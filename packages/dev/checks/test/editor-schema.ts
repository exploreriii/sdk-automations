/**
 * `docs/automations.schema.json` — what an editor checks an `automations.yml`
 * against, rendered from the same specs the parser reads that file with.
 *
 * A whole file rather than a block inside one: JSON carries no comments, so
 * there is no marker pair to write between and nothing hand-written to keep.
 * `generated.ts` holds the worklist both kinds of output share.
 *
 * The schema is a SPELLING check and says so in its own top-level
 * `description`. Injectivity, a `duration`'s ceiling and relations, the cascade,
 * the cross-file rule that a settings value naming a label or a principal must
 * name one this same document maps — every one of those is a question about two
 * places at once, or about a constant a pattern cannot carry, and JSON Schema
 * can ask neither. A maintainer who reads a green editor as
 * a parsed file is the failure this file must not create.
 *
 * Three vocabularies meet here and each one is walked rather than copied:
 * `TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` and `MAPPING_SECTION_KEYS` decide what the document admits,
 * and `describeSpec` decides what each capability's `settings` block admits.
 * The map from a field's kind to a subschema is exhaustive over
 * `FieldDescription["kind"]`, so a sixteenth constructor fails to compile here
 * until an editor knows what to do with it.
