/**
 * Everything `pnpm contracts` writes, and the worklist it walks: the contract
 * tables of `design/contracts/catalogue.md`, `design/contracts/facts.md` and
 * `design/contracts/safety.md`, the capability table and settings trees of
 * `docs/capabilities.md`, the constructor table of
 * `design/guides/capability-kits.md` §3, and — whole rather than in blocks —
 * the editor schema `editor-schema.ts` renders and the committed value each
 * shipped example parses to (`examples.ts`).
 *
 * The locks used to compare COLUMNS — a row list here, a permission there —
 * which left every cell no assertion reached free to drift, and left a red
 * lock with no instruction beyond "edit the table by hand until it matches".
 * Generating the whole table answers both: the document holds no fact the
 * code does not, and `pnpm contracts` is the fix.
 *
 * Two things the registries cannot give, so both are maps HERE and both are
 * mapped types over the code's own unions — a new operation, meaning or code
 * fails to compile until its entry follows (D76). The first is the desired
 * shape's field names and a resolver's input and output type names, which are
 * types and reach no runtime value. The second is the per-row sentence: a cell
 * that is prose is the one thing a generator cannot derive, so it lives here
 * where the review question is "is this sentence still true", asked once,
 * rather than in a document nothing compares.
 *
 * A table whose rows are all data keeps no sentence at all — the prose that
 * used to sit in a `Carries` column moved under the table, where review owns
 * it and no generator has to reproduce it. The constructor table did the same:
 * its `Rule it carries` column is a list below the block now.
 *
 * The settings surfaces are the same idea one layer down. A spec describes
 * itself, so the tree a maintainer reads, the sentence beside each key and the
 * schema their editor checks against are all walks of `describeSpec` — and the
 * sentence lives with the field rather than in three documents nothing
 * compares.
 *
 * NOT generated: everything outside the markers. The prose around each table
 * is hand-written and stays that way, which is why the rewriter replaces
 * blocks rather than files.
