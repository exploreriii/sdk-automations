/**

 * The table was a hand copy of fifteen constructors, and a constructor whose
 * reader changed what an absent key means left the guide saying the old thing
 * — the drift `catalogue-drift.test.ts` exists for, one layer down. Two of the
 * three columns are now derived, and the third is a reviewed sentence in
 * `generated.ts` (D76).
 *
 * One invariant per file (D89).
