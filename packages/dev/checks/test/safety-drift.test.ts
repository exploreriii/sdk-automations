/**
 * `design/contracts/safety.md` is the engine's contract, and a contract nothing
 * reads is a proposal wearing one's name. Its refusal and record-only tables
 * are GENERATED from `generated.ts`'s catalogues, and this holds the file to
 * them: an undocumented code, an invented row and a stale meaning are the same
 * defect seen from three sides, and comparing whole blocks catches all three
 * where a code list caught only the first.
 *
 * No runtime arrays exist for those unions, so each catalogue is a mapped type
 * over `SafetyRefusalCode` and `RecordOnlyCode` — a new code fails to COMPILE
 * in the generator until its row follows (D76). One invariant per file (D89).
