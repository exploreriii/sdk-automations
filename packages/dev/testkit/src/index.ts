/**
 * Test-only support shared by more than one package: the captured webhook
 * payloads, and the temp-dir helper every package that touches disk rewrote.
 *
 * Fixtures are MODULE-MEDIATED, never path-read from outside this package.
 * That is the `documents.ts` lesson (D82) stated as an interface: Stryker's
 * sandbox is the mutated package's own directory, so a fixture read by path
 * from somewhere above it is simply absent when the mutants run — the tests
 * pass, kill nothing, and report 0.00%. A fixture reached through a package
 * export travels with the dependency into the sandbox; a fixture reached
 * through `../../other-package/test/…` does not. Hence `bytes()`/`json()`
 * rather than an exported directory path: there is no path to leak.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: config and declaration builders. Core's tests are the
 * ones that want them, and core cannot depend on a package that depends on
 * core — the cycle the architecture check would reject on sight. A helper
 * graduates here only when a SECOND package needs it.
 *
 * The temp directory comes in two shapes, and they are not interchangeable.
 * `withTempDir` is the callback form: the directory's whole life is inside
 * one test or one helper function, where there is no `afterEach` to reach
 * for — the interleaving suite opens and closes its two store handles around
 * one. `useTempDir` is the hook form, and it is here because six suites had
 * hand-rolled the identical beforeEach/afterEach pair.
