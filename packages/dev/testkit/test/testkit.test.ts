/**
 * The testkit's own guarantees. Nothing here kills a mutant — there is no

 * that stopped parsing, a filename whose event prefix drifted from its
 * declared `event`, a `withTempDir` that leaks on the throwing path, or a
 * `useTempDir` that hands two tests the same directory would all be
 * invisible from the packages that consume them.
