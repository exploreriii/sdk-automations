# Capability probes — DISPOSABLE

Three capability stubs that exist to test the boundary they plug into.
They are **not** product scope, not a ranking, and not a prediction of what
stage four will choose. Same rule as [`lab/`](../dev/lab/README.md):
the harness is disposable, the evidence is the product.

## Why this exists

The runnable shell uses these probes to exercise the capability boundary and
produce observe or dry-run decisions. They also keep the capability-isolation
matrix concrete without treating any probe as product scope.

What the probes found is recorded as
D61–D73 in [`design/design2/decisions.md`](../../design/design2/decisions.md); eight of the thirteen
rows are gaps that no further work inside a single package would have
surfaced, because each package was individually correct. D72 needed more than
that again — it appeared only when this branch met the 2026-07-30 audit's
immutable destructive warnings, and neither change produced it alone.

## Why these three

Chosen for **contract diversity**, deliberately not for likelihood of being
ranked first — picking probable winners would have made this a scope decision
nobody made.

| Probe | The only one that… |
|---|---|
| `prQuality` | touches almost nothing: one resolver, one comment, no state, no mappings |
| `intake` | consumes mapped meanings, emits two intents from one observation, and declares **no** resolvers — so it is also the test that an undeclared resolver is unreachable |
| `inactivity` | is schedule-triggered and unprojected, proving the shared gate refuses `preconditionStale` instead of treating a capability claim as current-state evidence |

Between them: event vs. schedule, idempotent vs. non-idempotent,
mapping-consuming vs. not, and stateless vs. `durableState: required`.
Together they exercise the retained boundary without selecting a product capability.

## What the tests prove

| Suite | Claim |
|---|---|
| `test/boundary.test.ts` | The direct declaration set is admitted; the config projection leaks neither another capability's block nor a repository label string; the intent screen refuses undeclared, misattributed, and unprojected label intents |
| `test/engine-matrix.test.ts` | **P3**, tested: all eight subsets, each capability's behaviour identical regardless of neighbours, disabled capabilities never evaluated, with a negative control so the matrix cannot pass vacuously |
| `test/prQuality.test.ts` | A resolver that could not answer is never read as "no linked issue" — the sweep explains and emits nothing, while the same pull request with a real empty answer draws the comment |
| `test/intake.test.ts` | Without a mapped `awaitingTriage` the sweep explains and skips; an item positioned anywhere is left alone, because intake is the entry gate only |
| `test/inactivity.test.ts` | The act path dates `unassign` at `warnedAt` rather than the sweep — redating would restart the grace period — and a bot or undetermined assignee is skipped precisely where the next step is destructive |

The P3 run is the one worth flagging: [`build-plan.md`](../../design/build-plan.md)
§12 defers the toggle matrix past November because one capability cannot
violate the principle. That is right about the arithmetic and wrong about the
prerequisite — P3 is structural, so stubs test it as well as shipped code does
(D70).

## Deleting this package

When stage four names the first real capability:

1. Re-run the toggle matrix with the real capability substituted for its probe.
2. Move nothing from `src/` into the platform. A probe was chosen for
   diversity, not for demand; promoting one would turn a measuring instrument
   into a scope decision.
3. Delete `probes/` and remove it from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

`test/world.ts` is the one piece worth reading before it goes: `runEnabled`
uses the same direct capability list for config and evaluation, written as the
smallest thing that could work.

## What it does not prove

- Nothing about GitHub writes. Active mode is not implemented.
- Nothing about demand. These are not candidate capabilities.
- Nothing about effect recovery or live lease takeover.
