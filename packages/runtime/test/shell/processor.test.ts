/**
 * The worker's failure honesty: a crash mid-decision COUNTS an attempt —
 * the delivery stays durable, waits out a widening backoff, and is
 * eventually dead-lettered rather than retried forever — and a completed
 * delivery never runs twice. The receiver acknowledged long before any of
 * this; GitHub is not watching.
 *
 * Failures here are injected through the externals seam, which is the one
 * this worker actually meets (`live externals unavailable`) and the one
 * whose throw the processor sees: a capability that throws is contained by
 * `decide()` and reported, never raised.
 *
 * One case here is not about failure at all: the delivery that is refused
 * because it names another repository. It sits with these because it is
 * the fourth way a claimed delivery can end, and because what it must NOT
 * do — retry, dead-letter, or read a configuration — is what everything
 * else in this file is about.
