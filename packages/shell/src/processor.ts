/**
 * The worker half: claim a durable delivery, prepare, reject an unsupported
 * mode or call the one verb, then commit the outcome with completion. The
 * receiver acknowledged long ago; GitHub never observes retries here.
 *
 * The reading key: a claimed delivery always ends as exactly ONE of three
 * records — `configRejected`, `modeUnsupported`, or a decision — and there
 * is no fourth exit. The try/catch in `processOnce` is routing, not
 * handling: any throw releases the claim, and retry-by-reclaim IS the
 * recovery logic, which is why none lives here.
 *
 * `recordFor` below is stations ③ to ⑤ of this package's README table,
 * one named step per station.
