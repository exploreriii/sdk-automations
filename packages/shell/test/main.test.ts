/**
 * The composition root run as the real process: `node --import tsx
 * src/main.ts`, an environment, a socket and a SQLite file, with nothing
 * stubbed. Everything main.ts owns is observable from outside it — the
 * refusal to boot without its three variables, the line naming the port
 * and both file paths, and a signed delivery coming back as a persisted
 * report under exactly the store path that line announced.
 *
 * The mocked predecessor replaced node:fs, node:url, all three workspace
 * packages and all three sibling modules, so it could only prove that main
 * calls what main calls. Rewiring the composition would not have failed it.
 *
 * v8 attributes nothing across a spawn, so src/main.ts is excluded from
 * coverage in vitest.config.ts. The exclusion records where the coverage
 * went, not that the file is untested.
 *
 * Every child is killed twice over: a hard timer inside `withShell`, and
 * the wrapper's own `finally`. A boot that never reaches `listen` has to
 * end as a failed wait, never as a wedged run. Every child also binds
 * HOST=127.0.0.1, because a suite that opens a port to the network is a
 * suite that makes the machine ask its operator about it.

/**
 * Stryker runs in the process that runs the suite; this suite's subject
 * runs in another one. Two things have to cross that boundary, and
 * neither does on its own.
 *
 * Outward: the active mutant is named in a global here, and instrumented
 * code reads `__STRYKER_ACTIVE_MUTANT__` when its own global is empty. So
 * the variable is handed down. Without it every child runs unmutated code
 * and main.ts scores as perfectly tested while proving nothing.
 *
 * Homeward: mutant coverage is recorded in the child's global, and a
 * mutant that no test is recorded as reaching is never run at all — it is
 * reported "NoCoverage" and counted against the score exactly like a
 * survivor. So the child writes its coverage out as it dies, and the
 * counts are folded into what this test is recorded as covering.
 *
 * The homeward half looks like it should be a config fact instead —
 * `coverageAnalysis: "off"` would run every mutant against every test and
 * no fold would be needed. It was tried: the vitest runner ignores the
 * setting and analyses per test regardless, so main.ts came back 40×
 * NoCoverage and the gate broke at 76%. The fold is the only route.
 *
 * Both halves are inert outside a mutation run: `__stryker__` is only
 * there when Stryker put it there.
