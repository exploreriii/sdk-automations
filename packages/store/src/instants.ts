/**
 * The one timestamp the store accepts, and the ordering property that

 *
 * Every `<=` in `deliveries.ts`, `effects.ts` and `schedules.ts` is a

 * file imports nothing: all three concerns depend on it and it depends on
 * none of them.

/**
 * The ONE timestamp format the store accepts: exactly the
 * `Date.toISOString()` shape — millisecond precision, `Z` suffix.
 *
 * Constant width is what makes lexicographic order chronological order,
 * and every `<=` comparison in this package relies on that. Mixed precision
 * breaks it: `"…00Z" > "…00.500Z"` as strings, but earlier in time,
 * because `'Z'` sorts above `'.'`. An offset format sorts wrongly
 * outright. Both are caller bugs, so both throw rather than misorder.
 *
 * Exported so the shell can validate before a store call.
